##How the original data have been collected  
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.
##List of output variables  
The output dataset include 83 variables: 2 grouping variables [Activity and Subject] and 81 measure variables that represent the average of each variable in the original dataset for each activity and each subject.  
Activity : Activity performed by the subject on the experiment. Six different values or levels: LAYING SITTING STANDING WALKING WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS WALKING_UPSTAIRS
Subject : Volunteer that performed the experiment. Each different value represent one of the 30 volunteers that have participated in the experiment.
tBodyAcc-mean()-X : Average Body Acceleration on the X axis for the specified activity and subject.
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y : Average Body Acceleration on the Y axis for the specified activity and subject.
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z : Average Body Acceleration on the Z axis for the specified activity and subject.
tBodyAcc-std()-X : Average standard deviation for the Body Acceleration on the X axis for the specified activity and subject.
tBodyAcc-std()-Y : Average standard deviation for the Body Acceleration on the Y axis for the specified activity and subject.
tBodyAcc-std()-Z : Average standard deviation for the Body Acceleration on the Z axis for the specified activity and subject.
tGravityAcc-mean()-X : Average Gravity Acceleration on the X axis for the specified activity and subject.
tGravityAcc-mean()-Y : Average Gravity Acceleration on the Y axis for the specified activity and subject.
tGravityAcc-mean()-Z : Average Gravity Acceleration on the Z axis for the specified activity and subject.

tGravityAcc-std()-Z : Average standard deviation for the Gravity Acceleration on the Z axis for the specified activity and subject.
tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X : Average rate of change of acceleration; that is, the derivative of acceleration with respect to time on the X axis for the specified activity and subject.
tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y : Average rate of change of acceleration; that is, the derivative of acceleration with respect to time on the Y axis for the specified activity and subject.
tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z : Average rate of change of acceleration; that is, the derivative of acceleration with respect to time on the Z axis for the specified activity and subject.
tBodyAccJerk-std()-X : Average standard deviation of the rate of change of acceleration; that is, the derivative of acceleration with respect to time on the X axis for the specified activity and subject.
tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y : Average standard deviation of the rate of change of acceleration; that is, the derivative of acceleration with respect to time on the Y axis for the specified activity and subject.
tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z : Average standard deviation of the rate of change of acceleration; that is, the derivative of acceleration with respect to time on the Z axis for the specified activity and subject.
